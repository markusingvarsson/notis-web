/* 
  Note for Safari 14/iOS 14 compatibility:
  - Standard CSS transitions for transform and opacity are well-supported.
  - Using `translateX(100%)` for off-screen and `translateX(0)` for on-screen is robust.
  - `will-change` is a suggestion and might not be strictly necessary but can help performance.
  - Avoid complex animations or properties that might have spotty support in older versions.
